    TODO: This is the home screen of the app. It would be great to have some basic information about the club,
    such as contact info, college name, the logo, etc.
    
    Tips:
    - Use UILabels to display text
    - Use UIImageView to display an image
    - Be creative! Play around with settings such as colors, font sizes, and alignment
